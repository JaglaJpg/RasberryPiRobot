# Dancing Robot Project

### **Overview**
A Java program developed for a Raspberry Pi-powered robot that uses QR codes to perform pre-programmed "dances." This project integrates various robot functionalities, showcasing advanced programming skills.

### **Key Features**
- Scans QR codes to interpret hexadecimal values.
- Converts hex values into binary, decimal, and octal for robot behavior:
  - Binary: Determines movement direction (forward or turn).
  - Octal: Controls wheel speed.
  - Decimal: Sets LED RGB color.
- Includes obstacle avoidance and real-time color detection using ultrasound sensors and a camera.

### **Technologies Used**
- **Java**
- **Raspberry Pi SwiftBot API**

### **Setup and Running the Program**
Unfortunately the API and hardware required are owned by Brunel University London.
